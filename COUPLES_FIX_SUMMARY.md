# ðŸ”§ Couples Page Fix Summary

## ðŸš¨ **Issue Identified**
The Couples tab was broken due to several problems:

### **Root Causes:**
1. **API Dependency Failure**: Page was trying to call `fetchCouples()` API that requires a backend server
2. **Missing Mock Data**: No fallback data for development/testing environment  
3. **Outdated Styling**: Using old CSS classes instead of new wedding theme design system
4. **Error Handling**: React Query errors were not handled gracefully for missing backend
